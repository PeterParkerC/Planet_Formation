# Overview

The GENGA code, Gravitational Encounters in N-body simulations with GPU Acceleration, is an open source hybrid symplectic N-body integrator tailored for simulating late stage of planetary system formation. The latest version of code is also capable of implementing non-Newtonian forces including general relativity, tidal effect, rotational deformation, the Yarkovsky effect and Poynting-Robertson drag. We used GENGA to simulate different planetary systems.
