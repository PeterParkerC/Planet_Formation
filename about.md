Hi, my name is Peter Cheung! I am now a final year undergraduate student majoring in Physics and Earth System Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

I am studying mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum physics, thermo-statistical mechanics, relativity, solid state physics, astrophysics, particle and nuclear physics in Physics while in Earth System Science I am studying atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric chemistry, oceanography, aerosol science, solid and fluid mechanics, boudary layer interation and tropical meterology.

Among these courses, I am in particularly interested in all kinds of fluid dynamics including instabilities and MHD. In the future, I wish I can contribute to the exoplanet climatology field of study.

In my lesure time, I am also a pc gamer in mostly first person shooter gaming.
